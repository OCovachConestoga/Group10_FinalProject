    <h2>How to Play Spikeball: </h2>

    <p>Spikeball is a fast-paced 2-on-2 game played with a small round net placed between both teams.</p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Teams take turns hitting the ball onto the net so the opposing team cannot return it. The rally continues until the ball hits the ground, the rim, or a team fails to return it.</p>

    <h3>Basic Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each team is allowed up to three touches per turn to return the ball.</li>
      <li>The ball must be hit, not caught or thrown.</li>
      <li>Once the serve is made, there are no boundariesâ€”players can move freely around the net.</li>
      <li>A player may not hit the ball twice in a row.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Games are typically played to 21 points and must be won by 2 points.</li>
      <li>A point is scored when the opposing team fails to legally return the ball.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use all three touches strategically to set up a strong return.</li>
      <li>Communicate with your teammate.</li>
      <li>Stay quick on your feet and be ready for 360-degree play.</li>
    </ul>
